    <p>Kid Tripp was developed by programmer / pixel art enthusiast <a href='mailto:mike@ndygames.com'>Mike Burns</a>, who grew up playing tough-as-nails platformers and dreaming of one day making them himself. Kid Tripp is the product of two years of programming, drawing pixel art, and meticulous level design. And best of all... it's only the beginning!</p>
